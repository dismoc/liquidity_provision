# Public Lending as an Outside Option in Private Markets

[Paper](https://github.com/dismoc/liquidity_provision/blob/main/paper.pdf)

What role does the Central Bank plays as a lender of last resort?

Abstract: This paper constructs a New Monetarist model with public and private lending to analyze whether the discount window operated by the Federal Reserve serves a role aside from their primary purpose of last resort lending and interest rate control. The model shows two main results. Firstly, the discount window reduces the market power of lenders in the interbank market by serving as an outside option for borrowers during the bargaining. Second, if the discount window rate is sufficiently low, public lending can improve welfare by increasing aggregate consumption through the provision of external liquidity.
